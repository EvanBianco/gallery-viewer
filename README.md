# Gallery Viewer

The Gallery Viewer is a Python script that (optionally) generates a sequence of PNG images with random noise, with each image having a different hue. The script also includes a simple GUI viewer that allows you to navigate through the images using the arrow keys.

## Installation

To use the Gallery Viewer, you will need to have Python 3 and Tkinter installed on your system. You can install Tkinter using pip:

```
pip install tkinter
```

## Usage

To run the Gallery Viewer, simply run the `image_generator.py` script from the command line:

```
python image_generator.py
```

The script will generate 50 PNG images with random noise, each with a different hue, and save them to the `images` directory. The images will be named `image_0.png`, `image_1.png`, and so on.
gallery_viewer.py` script:

```
python gallery_viewer.py
```

The viewer will open and display the first image in the sequence. You can use the arrow keys to navigate through the images.

## Customization

You can customize the number of images generated by changing the value of the `NUM_IMAGES` variable in the `image_sequencer.py` script. You can also customize the size and file size of the images by modifying the `IMAGE_WIDTH`, `IMAGE_HEIGHT`, and `MAX_FILE_SIZE` variables in the script.
